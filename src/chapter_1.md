# Chapter 1 - Corporation Walkthrough

To get a feel for how your Corporation works it can be helpful to
interact with it through the game's user interface first.

## Creating your (First) Corporation

Head to the City Hall in Sector-12 to create your first
corporation. Since it's your first corporation you are most likely in
Bitnode 3. If you are you should choose to start with seed money from
the government. Earning the seed money to self-fund your corporation
under the harsh restrictions of Bitnode 3 takes an excessively long
time.

## Your First Division

Now that you've formed your corporation the first thing you will need
to do is choose an industry for your first division. It is _highly_
recommended that if you are new to the Corporation mechanic you start
by creating an Agriculture division first.
