## Building the Book Yourself

To build this book for yourself you will need to install [mdbook] and
the plugin [mdbook-admonish] and the backend [mdbook-linkcheck].

[mdbook]: https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/general.html
[mdbook-linkcheck]: https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/mdbook-linkcheck
[mdbook-admonish]: https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish

Once you have those programs installed you can simply run:

```bash
mdbook serve
```

Then you can view the rendered book in a web browser at http://localhost:3000
